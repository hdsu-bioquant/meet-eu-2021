## Organisation of the half-way forum 

### When? 

Friday, 12/17/2021, starting at 2 pm

### Where? 

Zoom meeting, link will be provided

### Schedule?

* 2 - 3 pm: presentations of the projects, CPT teams first, TAD teams second
* 3 - 3.15 pm: definition of the pairings
* 3.15 - 3.30 pm: presentation of the D-day (jury members, schedule...)
* 3.30 - 4 pm: Q&A session

### How? 

Each team will have **3 minutes** to show **3 slides**: 

1. outline of the method
2. preliminary results
3. technical challenges/limitations. 

We (the teachers) will ask questions (2 minutes). You can see it as a rehearsal for the final meeting (D-day) and an opportunity to meet. The session will not be evaluated.

### And after? 

After the half-way forum, we will define **pairs of teams**. We will randomize team pairing, with the constraints that the 2 teams in each pair must: (1) come from different universities, (2) address the same task. Your repo will be open to everyone.

### What to do next? 

Each team will have to **evaluate the results of its partner in the pair**. This implies defining metrics to compare predictions versus gold standard and to compare two sets of predictions. The metrics can be taken from the literature or "invented". The choice of metrics should be well motivated. The evaluation should be performed on results computed from several input data (several resolutions, several chromosomes..) and not just on "toy" data used for the development of the tool. 

We expect you to show a quantitative (and possibly qualitative) assessment of the results and to conduct a critical analysis. You can for example choose 2 metrics and discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks.

### Criteria for grading (final meeting)

* The jury members will **evaluate your reports and presentations** on the D-day. You will have access to these grades and they will contribute to your final grade.
* Your code will be evaluated by the teachers. It should be more than just pasting already developed programs and libraries. It should be well documented and well structured (modular, interfaced with the user with tunable options, easily maintainable...). Please do not put your code along with other documents in your github repo without subdirectories! You need to think about potential users and help them go through it. You will be penalised if you do not provide a functioning code.
 * The originality of your approach and your ability to have a critical analysis on your results and on the question addressed will be evaluated. **You will NOT be penalised if your results are not good**.
* We (the teachers) will also take into account the **quality of your report and your presentation**, and your involvement/participation in the project.
